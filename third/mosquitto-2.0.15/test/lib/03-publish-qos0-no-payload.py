# Test whether a client sends a correct PUBLISH to a topic with QoS 0 and no payload.

# The client should connect to port 1888 with keepalive=60, clean session set,
# and client id publish-qos0-test-np
# The test will send a CONNACK message to the client with rc=0. Upon receiving
# the CONNACK and verifying that rc=0, the client should send a PUBLISH message
# to topic "pub/qos0/no-payload/test" with zero length payload and QoS=0. If
# rc!=0, the client should exit with an error.
# After sending the PUBLISH message, the client should send a DISCONNECT message.
